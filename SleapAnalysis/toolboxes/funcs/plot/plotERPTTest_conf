# This is a configuration file in standard configuration file format
#
# Lines beginning with a hash or a semicolon are ignored by the application
# program. Blank lines are also ignored by the application program.

# Configuration option names are not case sensitive, but configuration parameter
# data is case sensitive and may be preserved by the application program.

# An optional equals sign can be used to separate configuration parameter data
# from the option name. This is dropped by the parser. 

# A configuration option may take multiple parameters separated by commas.
# Leading and trailing whitespace around parameter names and parameter data fields
# are ignored by the application program.
